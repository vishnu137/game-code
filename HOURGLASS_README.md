## üéÆ Game Features

### Visual Features
- **Realistic Hourglass Animation**: Beautifully rendered hourglass with smooth flip animations
- **Particle Physics**: Hundreds of sand particles with realistic gravity and collision detection
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Gradient backgrounds with floating decorative elements
- **Special Effects**: Sparkle effects, collection animations, and visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Gameplay Features
- **Flip Mechanics**: Click to flip the hourglass and reverse gravity
- **Gold Particles**: Collect special golden particles for bonus points and time
- **Level Progression**: Increasing difficulty with faster sand flow and stronger gravity
- **Timing Challenges**: Strategic flipping to maximize score and survival time
- **Score System**: Points for flips, gold collection, and level progression

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Click "Flip Hourglass" button or click on canvas to collect gold particles
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Space` - Flip the hourglass
  - `P` - Pause/Resume game
  - `R` - Restart game

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Objective**: Keep the game running by flipping the hourglass strategically while collecting gold particles for bonus points.

2. **Basic Mechanics**:
   - Sand particles fall due to gravity
   - Flip the hourglass to reverse gravity direction
   - Each flip gives you points based on your current level
   - Timer counts down - don't let it reach zero!

3. **Special Elements**:
   - **Gold Particles**: Sparkly golden particles that appear randomly
   - **Collection**: Click near gold particles to collect them
   - **Bonuses**: Gold particles give 50 √ó level points and +2 seconds

4. **Level Progression**:
   - Every 10 seconds, level increases
   - Higher levels = faster sand flow and stronger gravity
   - Each level up gives +5 bonus seconds

5. **Scoring**:
   - Flip hourglass: 10 √ó level points
   - Collect gold particle: 50 √ó level points + 2 seconds
   - Survive longer for higher scores
